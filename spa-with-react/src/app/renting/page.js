        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>Renting on EcoShare is a simple and efficient process. Users can list their items for rent, specifying details such as availability, rental price, and any terms or conditions. Renters can then browse available items, make bookings directly through the platform, and complete transactions securely. EcoShare provides a convenient way for users to access the tools and equipment they need without the commitment of ownership, promoting resource sharing and reducing waste.</p>
